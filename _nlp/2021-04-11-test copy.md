# When should we use Data Augmentation?

This article relies on two sources:
- the [original EDA paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.11196)
- the [GitHub implementation](https://github.com/jasonwei20/eda_nlp)

Data Augmentation techniques in NLP show substantial improvements on datasets with less than 500 observations, as illustrated by the original paper.

Classification accuracy can increase by as much as 3% if we create 16 augmented sentences per input sentence.

In this article, we'll go through the different data augmentation techniques and how to implement them by hand. The code is mostly from the EDA library, but extracting it and breaking it down is a good way to get used to those techniques. I'll also introduce the EDA package which wraps all this code into a single library.

# Data Augmentation Techniques 

The simple data augmentation techniques are the following:
- SR: synonym replacement
- RD: random deletion
- RS: random swap
- RI: random insertion

## Synonym replacement (SR)

Synonym replacement is a technique in which we replace a word by one of its synonyms. We use WordNet, a large linguistic database, to identify relevant synonyms.

```python
from nltk.corpus import wordnet 

def get_synonyms(word):
    """
    Get synonyms of a word
    """
    synonyms = set()
    
    for syn in wordnet.synsets(word): 
        for l in syn.lemmas(): 
            synonym = l.name().replace("_", " ").replace("-", " ").lower()
            synonym = "".join([char for char in synonym if char in ' qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm'])
            synonyms.add(synonym) 
    
    if word in synonyms:
        synonyms.remove(word)
    
    return list(synonyms)
```

This first function identifies the synonyms of a given word and pre-processes them. The synonyms are then randomly replaced in the original sentence.

```python
def synonym_replacement(words, n):
    
    words = words.split()
    
    new_words = words.copy()
    random_word_list = list(set([word for word in words if word not in stop_words]))
    random.shuffle(random_word_list)
    num_replaced = 0
    
    for random_word in random_word_list:
        synonyms = get_synonyms(random_word)
        
        if len(synonyms) >= 1:
            synonym = random.choice(list(synonyms))
            new_words = [synonym if word == random_word else word for word in new_words]
            num_replaced += 1
        
        if num_replaced >= n: #only replace up to n words
            break

    sentence = ' '.join(new_words)

    return sentence

```
